Workstation can be configured through Global Options \(named Preferences in macOS\). When Global Options are set, they are applied only to the current user’s profile and will persist until further changes are made. Configuration options for an individual user, such as metadata profiles, lists, and saved searches, can be saved as case options.

This window presents a list of existing profiles that have been created.
