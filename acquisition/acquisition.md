## Acquisition Method

### FastBloc SE

1. Make sure no devices are attached (or only your storage device is attached)
2. Tools > FastBloc SE > Write Blocked
3. Attach the target device to the system
4. In EnCase, either create a new case or open an existing one
5.  Add Evidence > Add Local Device
6. On the page that follows, accept the defaults and click Next. On the screen that follows, you will see a dot or Yes in the Write Blocked column, and the icon for the device will have a green box around it, both indicating a successful write block.
7. Select the write-blocked target device (blue check) > Finish > double click the evidence > Acquire

```
Write Block = writes are prevented but are cached locally to prevent Windows error messages
Write Protect =  writes are prevented, nothing is cached locally, and Windows launches error messages when writes are attempted

```

After finished acquiring > Physically remove the device 
> Stop the write-blocking software in EnCase (Tools > FastBloc SE > Clear All)
