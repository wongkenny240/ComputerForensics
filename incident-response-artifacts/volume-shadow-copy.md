# Volume Shadow Copy

Vista/Win7/Win8 now logs changes to the entire Volume and keeps track of the specific clusters that are changed on a daily basis in the new Volume Snapshot Service or VSS. 

Vista/Win7 Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate have Shadow Copy enabled by default. 

Enables a user to: 
* Revert the file to any previous version 
* Restore a previous version from backup 
* Make a copy of previous version 

All volume shadow copy files are stored in the ‘System Volume Information’ folder on the root of the volume and are recognizable by their names. 

The number ***3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752***, is a unique identifier specific to the volume shadow service.
